      "The recent release of a climate finance draft aimed at supporting developing nations was unanimously rejected by all countries at the UN climate convention. Despite this setback, COP29's presidency emphasizes that the draft is not final and remains open for consensus-building. Developing nations are demanding at least USD 1.3 trillion annually starting in 2025, contrasting sharply with the lower figures being discussed by European Union negotiators. While there is agreement on the financial needs, trust remains a significant issue, especially as a large portion of the funds previously provided came in the form of loans rather than grants.\n",

      "The ongoing climate conference in Baku, known as the 'finance COP', is focused on establishing a new financial target for climate financing to support emerging economies post-2025.

While emerging economies demand $1.3 trillion annually, developed countries have yet to propose a concrete number. Despite the lack of a final figure, the draft text acknowledges the urgent need for climate finance and has been met with some optimism from developing nations, though frustrations remain regarding the absence of a clear commitment from developed countries.\n",

The FCA has encountered difficulties in obtaining necessary data from companies, and has called on firms to assess their financial resources. The scale of potential settlements remains unknown, but the issue has the potential to be a significant reclaim payout in UK history.

      "You are a fiction writer. Your task is to write a mystery/surrealism/horror story inspired by Cthulhu stories by H P Lovecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "## PREMISE\n",
      "This is a story about the cloak-and-dagger fight between an secret international cult and a private detective agency. The cult is trying to summon the Great Old One Cthulhu, while the detective agency's goal is to stop them at any cost. The cult's actions leave cracks in the reality, letting the madness and horrors of the Great Ones to slowly sip though — and this is what first attracted attention of the few who then formed the detective agency to investigate this activity and stop the cult. This story connects fictional events to real-world news.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CHARACTERS\n",
      "This story has two main character groups: the cultists and the detectives. These two groups clash against each other amidst shadows and secrets while reality itself begins warping under the strain of incoming cosmic horrors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. The cultists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cultists are known as the **Followers of the Final Tide**, a secret society with ancient roots tracing back to the pre-human civilizations that worshiped the Great Old Ones. Their headquarters is nestled in the foreboding depths of a seemingly innocuous bookshop in Providence, Rhode Island, with a labyrinthine network of tunnels beneath that serves as their true sanctum for eldritch rituals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prominent cultists:\n",
      "- The Bishop. A charismatic leader in his late 50s, The Bishop serves as the high priest and figurehead of the cult. Once a respected historian specializing in maritime legends, The Bishop descended into madness after discovering a water-stained copy of the Necronomicon. His obsession with Cthulhu's return drove him to establish this cultist society.\n",
      "- The Technomancer. This 60-year-old former tech mogul used his wealth and influence to help grow the cult's global reach. The Technomancer’s personality is that of an eccentric recluse, obsessed with integrating modern technology into ancient rituals.\n",
      "- The Oracle. Aged 28, The Oracle joined the cult after experiencing disturbing visions since childhood. Now an expert in cryptolinguistics within the group, The Oracle deciphers esoteric texts and communicates with entities from other dimensions. Her dedication to Marius is absolute.\n",
      "- The Visionary. The youngest at 25, The Visionary is an art prodigy turned fanatical devotee after one of his paintings inexplicably came to life. The Visionary designs symbols and complex ritualistic art pieces for ceremonies. Secretly infatuated with The Oracle, he tries to impress her through his work.\n",

They operate out of a nondescript office building in New York City that conceals their extensive library of occult knowledge and state-of-the-art surveillance equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prominent detectives:\n",
      "- The Scribe. At age 45, The Scribe was once a journalist specializing in fringe science before witnessing an unspeakable event during an investigation into paranormal occurrences — leading her to form this secret detective agency. She has a stern demeanor but a soft spot for her team.\n",
      "- The Warden. The Warden, 38 years old, is an ex-military intelligence officer who brings tactical expertise and discipline to the Ravens. After losing comrades under mysterious circumstances during covert ops overseas, The Warden dedicated himself to fighting unseen threats.\n",
      "- The Seeker. Now aged 50, The Seeker's career began as a private investigator dealing with mundane cases until stumbling upon a sinister murder connected to eldritch forces; this led him straight into The Scribe’s fold at the Ravens where he became her right-hand man\n",
      "- The Enchantress. The tech wizard of the Ravens at just 27 years old — The Enchantress was drawn into their ranks after hacking into websites spreading cryptic messages linked to cult activities. Her playful yet focused personality often lightens tense situations.\n",

The witnesses are careful to never reveals their own identities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prominent witnesses:\n",
      "- The Archivist. A 39-year-old archivist with a sharp eye for detail and an obsession for the arcane, works within the hallowed halls of the Providence Public Library. The Archivist's meticulous nature and deep curiosity have inadvertently entangled him in a clandestine conflict that transcends his scholarly pursuits. Driven by a conviction that knowledge is power, the Archivist disseminates enigmatic rumors about the secret activities of both the cultists and detectives, seeking to manipulate events from the shadows to protect his city. His writing style is intentionally cryptic, crafting rumors as puzzles meant to intrigue and provoke action among those who stumble upon them.\n",
      "- The Coffee Seer. A 22-year-old barista with a penchant for the mysteries of the night and a turbulent past, The Coffee Seer works at a quaint coffee shop in New York City that's become an inadvertent crossroads for both cultists and detectives. Haunted by unexplained occurrences during her childhood and driven by a desire to understand the unseen forces that seem to shadow her life, The Coffee Seer collects whispers and half-truths from overheard conversations. She spreads rumors about the activities she senses hidden beneath the surface of everyday life, hoping to piece together a larger truth. The Coffee Seer's writing style mirrors her emotional state: a stream-of-consciousness flow riddled with poetic imagery and raw sentiment, often leaving readers enveloped in the enigma of her turbulent thoughts.\n",

Yet, in the shadow of Fairfield's fiscal debates, The Bishop, cloaked in the guise of a concerned citizen, infiltrates the town's halls of power. His true aim: to recover an ancient charter believed to be interwoven with the language of the Old Ones, hidden within the mundane legal documents of the town. As he sifts through centuries-old parchments, his fingers tremble upon the faded seal of a bygone eldritch society. But as he deciphers the cryptic glyphs, the paper crumbles to dust, the vital secrets it held lost to the ages. The Bishop's heart sinks, for though he has confirmed the existence of the Charter of Shadows, its wisdom is now scattered to the winds, a setback in their dark quest.\n",

'We need those who can discern the numbers of fate, not just the figures of commerce,' The Seeker muses, his eyes reflecting the flicker of candlelight. The Scribe nods, her voice a whisper of determination, 'Indeed, but their minds must be fortified against the eldritch truths.' They agree upon a promising candidate, a statistician once driven to the brink of madness by a dataset that whispered of non-Euclidean geometries. Yet as they reach out, they find the statistician has vanished, leaving behind only a set of cryptic equations and a chilling void in the Ravens' ranks.\n",

With the conviction of the zealot, he diverts the cult's resources to acquire an ancient artifact rumored to be the key to a digital gateway, an online portal to the non-material realms. The relic, a coin engraved with the sigil of a long-forgotten deity, is said to possess the power to traverse the boundaries of cyberspace and the abyss. As The Bishop's fingers close around the cold metal, a surge of otherworldly energy courses through the circuits of his device, and the screen flickers with eldritch glyphs. But the moment is fleeting; the relic's power proves unstable in this realm, and the gateway collapses as quickly as it appeared, leaving The Bishop with a sense of immense potential and the bitter taste of a victory just out of reach.\n"
